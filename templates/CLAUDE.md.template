└── types/        # Type definitions
```

### Key Entry Points
- API: `src/api/index.ts`
- Main: `src/index.ts`

### Key Relationships
- [Document important patterns and how components interact]

## Conventions

### Code Style
- [Naming conventions]
- [File organization rules]
- [Import ordering]

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits: feat|fix|docs|refactor|test|chore
- Include ticket number when applicable

### Testing
- Unit tests: `npm test`
- Integration: `npm run test:integration`
- Coverage: `npm run test:coverage`

## Common Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Production build
npm test         # Run tests
npm run lint     # Run linter
```

## Current State

### Phase
[e.g., Phase 1: MVP Development]

### Active Work
- [Current feature/task being developed]

### Known Issues
- [ ] [List known bugs or technical debt]

### Recent Decisions
- [DATE]: [Decision and rationale]

### Known Gaps
- [ ] [Features not yet implemented]

## Critical Constraints

1. **[Constraint Name]**: [Description of constraint and why it matters]
2. **[Constraint Name]**: [Description]

## Session Instructions

### Before Starting
1. Read this file completely
2. Check `docs/session-notes/` for recent context
3. Run tests to verify baseline: `npm test`
4. Note the current dogfooding status below

### During Work
- Use `/plan` before implementing anything significant
- Use `/assumptions` to surface hidden assumptions
- Use `/verify` before marking tasks complete
- Use `/security-review` for security-sensitive code
- Track assumptions explicitly using TodoWrite
- Search online before major architectural decisions

### Before Ending
- Run `/handoff` to capture session state
- Update "Current State" section above
- Commit work in progress
- Run `scripts/metrics/collect-session-metrics.sh` if available

### Security Checklist (for AI-generated code)
Before committing, verify:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation present where needed
- [ ] No SQL/command/XSS injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependencies exist (not hallucinated names)
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose internal details

## Dogfooding Log
